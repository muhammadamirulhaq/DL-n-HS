# DL-n-HS
Deep Learning &amp; Haskell

A deep learning implementation has been developed in the Haskell programming language, encompassing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The implementation is entirely code-based without the reliance on external libraries.
